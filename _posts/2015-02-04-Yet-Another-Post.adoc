= Yet Another Post
:hp-tags: AsciiDoc, theme

Anthonny is helping me to get this thing going. Now that I have my default branch set to "gh-pages", it is working pretty well.

I want to figure out how tags work.

== How Tags Work

 :hp-tags: tag1,tag2


== Add Post Image
and you can also add a post image with

 :hp-image: http://url-image


Next I will play around with the themes and try to customize my own.

CAUTION: HubPress.io uses AsciiDoc (admonition here)

This is great.
