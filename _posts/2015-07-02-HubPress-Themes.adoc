= HubPress Themes
:hp-tags: theme

There are five built in themes at this time. They are:

* Casper
* ichi
* Roon
* Saga
* uno

Currently I like the uno theme for it's dark forest splash page. Then the blog link moves that to a left bar showing the posts on the right.

I like the way Saga shows your five posts on the home page like little cards. But the LOAD MORE + is not working correctly for me. I like the dark header on the Posts where the title that drops and fades in.

The ichi theme is a blue and white theme with an author card.

The other themes seem pretty sterile.
